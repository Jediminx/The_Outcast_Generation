        <h2>Dealing with negativity!</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of negative people out there and sometimes they can be hard to deal with. However, there are ways of interacting 
          and still maintaining your peace. I know its easier said than done but just smile, try to understand and let them know they are heard.
          Making others feel heard and shining a little light on them will hopefully brighten their day! Negative people feel alone, it's our job to help them 
          as well as ourselves! <br>

        <h2>Past Traumas</h2>
        <p>The past can really hurt sometimes, I know that I still struggle with my own past demons but that doesn't stop me from 
          achieving my goals and looking towards the future. All the bad things that happens to us in the past should not make us weak
          instead it should make us stronger, wiser, and more secure in ourselves because we got through it and we are still alive and 
          kicking today! The past is behind you! You're okay, there is no need to look back.

        <h2>Fear is NOT your master!</h2>
        <p>Franklin D Roosevelt once said: "The only thing to fear is fear itself." We can accomplish great things if we look at problems 
          face on rather than being held back by doubt and fear. I myself have stepped away from the fear of failure and the fear of others 
          opinions and I have been accomplishing things I never dreamed of. Don't let fear control you! You can do anything you put your 
          mind to!

        <h2>Grieving process</h2>
        <p>The old me has passed on, past me no longer exists. I have said my goodbyes to the old me and now I am building a better 
      more confident me. I have finally reached the end of my grievence process and now I am ready to move on from the darkness that
    had me locked up. Everyone grieves differently, just try not to wait too long because you might miss some great opportunities. </p>
