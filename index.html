      <main class="grid-item main"> I have been watching and waiting to see if the world will finally rest
        its dark ways. I know Star Wars is its own franchise. However we can take what they have 
        taught us with the way of the Force and of the dark side.I never really understood what the meaning 
        of the Force was and I had no idea what could come of it. I felt defeated all the time, constantly questioning 
        myself and my choices. I have lived most of my life in the dark side and I can tell you 
        it's not worth it. After I was told of the ways and start living by it, I felt more alive. I felt like I could see 
        clearly and be able to move on from the hatred I grew up with. We can build our own society 
        of "Jedi" and be able to live in peace together.<br> <image src="https://i0.wp.com/asyourpoetshavesaid.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/star-wars-episode-vi-return-of-the-jedi_good_evil.jpg?resize=800%2C510&ssl=1" width=250px alt="GoodvsEvil">
      </main>
      <aside class="grid-item aside-one">If you so chose the way of the dark side you must live with the 
        choice to becoming evil and hateful. Just like with Darth Vader, he had a choice to be 
        good and not base his choices on emotions but instead he walked with great sorrow till
        the day his son Luke changed him in his last dying moments. <img src="./images/vader-and-storm-troopers.jpg" alt="vader-and-storm-troopers" width=200px> <image src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Vader-death-Return-of-the-Jedi.jpg?fit=720%2C405&p=1" width=200 alt="Vader&Luke">

      <aside class="grid-item aside-two">If you choose the ways of the force you could live you life in peace
        loving yourself and others. We will not have to fight and we will not base our life choices on a feeling.
        For feeelings are fleeting and they never truly last. If we rely too much on our emotions and stop thinking with an open heart and open 
        mind then we are no better than the ones who chose to suffer in their own hatred.<br><br>
