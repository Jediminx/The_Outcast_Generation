    <h1 class="header">Iroh's Corner</h1>
    <main>
    <p class= "border">"Why don't you sit back and have a cup of calming Jazmine tea." As the great Uncle Iroh use to say.
        Now that you have come this far, lets take a moment to just breathe. Don't think about what's going on around you and instead 
        just focus on peace. As you breathe with every inhale think "I am one." With every exhale think, "I am alive." Repeat that as much 
        as you will like and after you have had some tea, enjoyed the ombiance and have relaxed its time we learn to get 
        along with others. You can not have a stable community without friendships and alleys to lift you up. I know making new
        friends is hard and scary sometimes but at moments like that we have to remember that everyone here feels the same 
        and that you are not alone. You can now rest easy knowing we have eachothers backs here and we will not let anyone fall 
        mercy to their fears. In the world we live in today, everyone is filled with fear anger and hatred. I don't blame people for being this way, due to the economic down fall 
        and the down fall of human kindness is really starting to show and its scary to see that little kids are acting just as bad as the adults. 
        We as the Outcast Generation have to come together and show that with a little bit of kindness, people can change. I am not saying that 
        it will always work because of all the generational hate that has been passed down from the previous generations. All we can do now is 
        be kind, show love not only to others but ourselves. We are always in constant battle with ourselves and others. Its time we stand up 
        and help others. We are all humans in the end no matter the color of your skin, your beliefs or backgrounds. No one is perfect
        we all make mistakes but being kind and helping others can truly make a difference,
