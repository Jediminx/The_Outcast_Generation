    <p>"Why don't you sit back and have a cup of calming Jazmine tea." As the great Uncle Iroh use to say.
        Now that you have come this far, lets take a moment to just breathe. Don't think about what's going on around you and instead 
        just focus on peace. As you breathe with every inhale think "I am one." With every exhale think, "I am alive." Repeat that as much 
        as you will like and after you have had some tea, enjoyed the ombiance and have relaxed its time we learn to get 
        along with others. You can not have a stable community without friendships and alleys to lift you up. I know making new
        friends is hard and scary sometimes but at moments like that we have to remember that everyone here feels the same 
        and that you are not alone. You can now rest easy knowing we have eachothers backs here and we will not let anyone fall 
        mercy to their fears.

        <p> Just like the Jedi page we will have an open message board to help each other find humility and resist being prideful. We
            need to realize the change in the world and the fact that with having everyone divided will only weaken us as a society. 
            Showing kindness and love is what this world needs, I recently
