              <p>Welcome to the Outcast Generation!</p>
              <h1>We Are The New Hope</h1>
            </div>
            
            <p>With the economy crumbing around us and  with the government no longer our ally, we as the Outcast Generation can build our own community with no politics, no judgement and no lewdness.</p>
              
              <p>I have created a safe place for anyone who is open-minded enough to focus on peace and the ways of a Jedi. You too can be a Jedi and help others who are consumed by the darkside!</p>
        
            <p>It only takes a small act of kindness and compassion to change a persons view point on others. Lets put an end to the hatred, as Master Yoda once said "Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate hate leads to suffering!"
