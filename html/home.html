            <p>Here we will be learning the ways of a Jedi (in a sence) and learing about humility, detatching yourself from the 
                toxicity of others that only want to bring us down, and keeping a calm mindset when provocted by the Sith. There will be 4 different
                sections that you can go through to help you reason and acknowlege the problems in your life. Once you have acknowleged what you want to fix 
                in your life you can pick out of the 4. Theres a Jedi section, an Uncle Iroh's corner, an anime main character personality traits, and 
                a Bible page. I know a lot of "Christians" make themselves seem like they are much better than the rest of the population. However, I 
                do not condone that. I feel as though evryone could chose to believe in God and follow his path or not, this is a judgement free zone.
                I recently got closer to God and I feel happier, more content with myself and I hope that others who are too scared to admit that they 
                are wanting a relationship with him can see that its okay and it could really help your emotional states. Go to the about tab 
                to see more about me and what I want from this page.  Please sign up and help make a brighter future for everyone!

                  situation, protect others and what to be the hero of the movie! A really good anime to watch when it comes to heros is "
                  My Hero Acedamia." I will be adding in a chat area for all who want to send ideas about being a hero and how we can 
                  use that in everyday situations.
