    <header class="header">Welcome to the Outcast Generation!</header>
    <article class="main">
      <p>Welcome one and all to the next generation! This is the place where we as a person of the human race can come and be yourself.
        No judgement, no trolls, only people who want to make this world a better place a place where we don't have to live in constant fear and 
        anger.  I never really understood technology or how the world works. However, now that I am getting into Software Developement, 
        my eyes have been open to new inventive ideas that can help build up not only the 
        technology but to also build up people who are in the dark pits
        they have been subjected to. The world has become so cold and heartless and I know being an outcast 
        myself, that with a little bit of kindness and love we can change the world as a whole. </p><br> <p>I'm a 25 year old mother of a 3 year old, working a full time job and still trying to find time to study and make ends meet. My daughter and I have been living on my family's farm for about two years now and I have been getting a lot of help from my family. I always thought I was weak for asking help but I am really glad I let go of my ego and really started to think more logically. As the creater of this page I hope to be able to gather a strong group of outcasts to help me find ways to help others and spread love and kindness all around. For almost my entire life I have never really known who I was or what I wanted to do. All I knew was that I am here for a reason. I wandered through life with no real goals in mind. I felt lost, empty and alone. So I took it appon myself to find out who I am. I have been going on a journey of the mind and the soul.
        Everyday I try to be better than I was the day before. Now that I have finally gotten my mind cleared and started thinking more positive, I have found my dream to one day change the world so that the next generations don't have to suffer as much as we have. I cannot wait to hear everyones ideas and be able to shape a brighter future.</p>

    <aside class="aside aside-2">This page will help the growth of thinking more logical rather than emotional. I want to be able to teach 
      everyone that as bad as things can be, reacting]emotionally will not get us anywhere. Emotions come and go everyday so its best 
      to stop, think and rationalize the situation. This will not be an over night experience, given that the fact that I am still learning myself. We can grow together and help bring others up as well.
